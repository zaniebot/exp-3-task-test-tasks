# Plan a calculator module

Create a design document at docs/calculator-design.md for a simple calculator module. The design should cover: add, subtract, multiply, divide operations. Then create follow-up tasks (using 'tasks new') for implementing each operation as a separate module. Create at least 2 follow-up tasks.

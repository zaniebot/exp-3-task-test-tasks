# Implement calculator add and subtract modules

Implement the add and subtract operations for the calculator module as described in docs/calculator-design.md.

Steps:
1. Create calculator/\_\_init\_\_.py with imports for add and subtract.
2. Create calculator/add.py with an `add(a, b)` function.
3. Create calculator/subtract.py with a `subtract(a, b)` function.
4. Create tests/test_add.py and tests/test_subtract.py with unit tests covering normal, edge, and negative-number cases.
5. Ensure all tests pass.

Created docs/calculator-design.md — a design document for a simple calculator module covering:
- Module structure (calculator/ package with add.py, subtract.py, multiply.py, divide.py)
- Function signatures with type hints for all four operations
- Error handling strategy (ZeroDivisionError for divide)
- Testing strategy with per-operation test files

Created 2 follow-up tasks:
1. "Implement calculator add and subtract modules" — covers add.py, subtract.py, and their tests
2. "Implement calculator multiply and divide modules" — covers multiply.py, divide.py, and their tests

Changes committed (not pushed) on the working branch.

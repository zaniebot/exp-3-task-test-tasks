- Created tests/test_add.py with 6 unit tests (positive, negative, mixed sign, zeros, floats, large numbers)
- Created tests/test_subtract.py with 6 unit tests (positive, negative, mixed sign, zeros, floats, large numbers)
- Added .gitignore for __pycache__ and .pyc files
- All 12 tests pass successfully

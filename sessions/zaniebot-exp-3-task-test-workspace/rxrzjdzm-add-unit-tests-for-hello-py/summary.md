Added unit tests for hello.py and updated README.md:

1. Created test_hello.py with two pytest tests:
   - test_main_output: captures stdout and verifies main() prints "Hello from the task queue!"
   - test_main_no_stderr: verifies main() produces no stderr output

2. Added a "Testing" section to README.md explaining how to install pytest and run the tests.

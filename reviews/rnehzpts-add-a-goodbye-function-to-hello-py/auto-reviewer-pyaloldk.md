# Code Review

## Summary
The task asked to: (1) add a `goodbye()` function to `hello.py` that prints "Goodbye from the task queue!", (2) call it after `main()` in the `__main__` block, and (3) update `README.md`.

## What was done well
- All three requirements are met precisely.
- The `goodbye()` function prints the exact requested string.
- It is called after `main()` in the `__main__` block.
- README.md is updated with a clear description and expected output.
- Code style is clean and consistent with the existing file.
- Single, well-described commit.

## Issues or concerns
- None. The change is minimal and correct.
